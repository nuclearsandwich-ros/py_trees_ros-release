ros-dashing-py-trees-ros (1.0.0-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  Stripped down and rebuilt for ROS2:
  * [behaviours] the familiar subscriber and action client behaviours
  * [blackboard] the exchange, mostly unmodified
  * [infra] colcon build environment
  * [trees] simpler communications, just one serialised tree snapshot, watchers do the rest
  * [watchers] revamped 'blackboard' and new 'tree' watcher
  What's missing:
  * [logging] the basic mechanisms have moved to py_trees, the rosbag implementation is to come
